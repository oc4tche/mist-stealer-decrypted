## wanna add this...
he have a method to bypass app_bound_encryption (new chrome 127+) by getting cookies with websocket module
also his entire code is skidded from doenerium; like all nodejs stealers on telegram or github
codded with AI prompts and doesnt have any protection on the api so can easly be shotdown with a simple abuse report
just need to change the sending (msg and files) method to be on telegram or discord and not his shitty ass api (i'll try to work on it)
